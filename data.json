Here&#8217;s what I learned from that experience.</p>\\n<p><!--more--></p>\\n<p>As a 17-year-old interested in photography &amp; not super inclined to attend college once done with school, the only way I saw it was to grow my Instagram so I could leverage that into getting actual jobs. And when I did get serious about growing on Instagram, I read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos on what strategies to follow / things to do to achieve the same and, here is a concise list of what came up:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Post quality pictures</li>\\n<li>Post daily</li>\\n<li>Target audience</li>\\n<li>Ideal time to post</li>\\n<li>Who you know &amp; interact with</li>\\n<li>Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>While the list varies from blog to blog and video to video, the first two points, post quality pictures and post daily, are constant throughout. And, if you&#8217;re up for a good challenge like I was a while back, you&#8217;ll decide to accept the challenge. Here is what you have to keep in mind:</p>\\n<h3><b>1. You have to create daily. No excuses.</b></h3>\\n<p>When I took on the challenge of posting daily I did not realize what I was getting myself into. I am a full-time student who shoots for fun and I did not keep in mind that I simply don&#8217;t have the time to create daily. If you&#8217;re going to commit to posting daily, you will have to find out a way you can do so without making other aspects of your life suffer. Which brings me to my second point:</p>\\n<h3><b>2. You will eventually get a creative block. Period.</b></h3>\\n<p>If you find a way to create daily without making other aspects of your life suffer, specially things like studying (school or college, either way), you will have to drop certain things you used to do on a daily basis. You will have to prioritize.</p>\\n<p>And I&#8217;m guessing a lot of you, like me, chose to create over consuming. DON&#8217;T DO THAT. How you get ideas depends on what you take in. It can be a talk with your best friend, reading a book or simply scroll through your Instagram feed. If you don&#8217;t prioritize consumption over creation at some point during this daily Instagram post spree, you will get a creative block. Which brings me to my <b>main point</b>:</p>\\n<h3><strong>What if you do end up getting a creative block?</strong></h3>\\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you do end up getting a creative block, you&#8217;ll not be able to create good quality content to post and you&#8217;ll try to push through and post something. And, let me assure you that whatever you post, you&#8217;ll be posting only for the sake of posting and not because it&#8217;s a good picture. Without good content, nothing matters. You control what your audience sees and if someone doesn&#8217;t follow you, it&#8217;s because they didn&#8217;t like what they say. You control if someone follows you or not.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I do to get over a creative block:</p>\\n<p><b>I consume stuff.</b></p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s the first and the only thing I do. I stop trying to create what in the short-run seems to be &#8220;quality&#8221; content and started focussing on what actually matters. It\\u00a0starts by going through my Instagram feed, consuming what others are putting out instead of worrying about what my next picture should look like. I then move on to start reading more and more, blogs or books, either way. And then, I start looking into the news and learning about what&#8217;s happening around me.</p>\\n<p>I think that&#8217;s the best way to go about it. By the end of the week, you&#8217;ll have a lot of opinions about a lot of things which will then translate into fresh ideas for content. And, for the record, that&#8217;s what I did while writing this post too. It&#8217;s not just Instagram we&#8217;re talking about here, it&#8217;s everything where creativity is required.</p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

And, if you&#8217;re up for a good challenge like I was a while back, you&#8217;ll decide to accept the challenge. Here is what you have to keep in mind:</p>\n<h3><b>1. You have to create daily. No excuses.</b></h3>\n<p>When I took on the challenge of posting daily I did not realize what I was getting myself into. I am a full-time student who shoots for fun and I did not keep in mind that I simply don&#8217;t have the time to create daily. If you&#8217;re going to commit to posting daily, you will have to find out a way you can do so without making other aspects of your life suffer. Which brings me to my second point:</p>\n<h3><b>2. You will eventually get a creative block. Period.</b></h3>\n<p>If you find a way to create daily without making other aspects of your life suffer, specially things like studying (school or college, either way), you will have to drop certain things you used to do on a daily basis. You will have to prioritize.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m guessing a lot of you, like me, chose to create over consuming. DON&#8217;T DO THAT. How you get ideas depends on what you take in. It can be a talk with your best friend, reading a book or simply scroll through your Instagram feed. If you don&#8217;t prioritize consumption over creation at some point during this daily Instagram post spree, you will get a creative block. Which brings me to my <b>main point</b>:</p>\n<h3><strong>What if you do end up getting a creative block?</strong></h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you do end up getting a creative block, you&#8217;ll not be able to create good quality content to post and you&#8217;ll try to push through and post something. And, let me assure you that whatever you post, you&#8217;ll be posting only for the sake of posting and not because it&#8217;s a good picture. Without good content, nothing matters. You control what your audience sees and if someone doesn&#8217;t follow you, it&#8217;s because they didn&#8217;t like what they say. You control if someone follows you or not.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I do to get over a creative block:</p>\n<p><b>I consume stuff.</b></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the first and the only thing I do. I stop trying to create what in the short-run seems to be &#8220;quality&#8221; content and started focussing on what actually matters. It\u00a0starts by going through my Instagram feed, consuming what others are putting out instead of worrying about what my next picture should look like. I then move on to start reading more and more, blogs or books, either way. And then, I start looking into the news and learning about what&#8217;s happening around me.</p>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s the best way to go about it. By the end of the week, you&#8217;ll have a lot of opinions about a lot of things which will then translate into fresh ideas for content. And, for the record, that&#8217;s what I did while writing this post too. It&#8217;s not just Instagram we&#8217;re talking about here, it&#8217;s everything where creativity is required.</p>\n",

They only collect things that they really love.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>In today&#8217;s day and age, it&#8217;s hard to keep oneself from being addicted to forms of content. For me, it&#8217;s Instagram and YouTube, I&#8217;m on these two apps all the time. I love going through my Instagram feed, stories on Instagram and watching videos on YouTube.</p>\\n<p>One of the side effects of being addicted to consuming content is that we tend to collect a lot of ideas, and, most of these ideas are straight up trash. While I&#8217;m not exactly working on getting off this addiction anytime soon, what I do want to work on being minimalistic with the ideas I collect. Bad ideas are just like junk food. They&#8217;re going to mess you up in the long run.</p>\\n<p>But you&#8217;ll end up collecting them anyway and so will I, what I mean by being minimalistic is consciously thinking about which ideas you really love and which ones you don&#8217;t AND then, there will be the ones that you feel very strongly about. For or against, either way. You&#8217;ll always come across ideas that you want people to not pick up, ideas that you want to speak against. Those are the ideas right next to what I like to think of as &#8220;good ideas&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>Consciously filter ideas you find on the internet and elsewhere.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>You\\u2019re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.

Not a hoarder, mind you, there\u2019s a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In today&#8217;s day and age, it&#8217;s hard to keep oneself from being addicted to forms of content. For me, it&#8217;s Instagram and YouTube, I&#8217;m on these two apps all the time. I love going through my Instagram feed, stories on Instagram and watching videos on YouTube.</p>\n<p>One of the side effects of being addicted to consuming content is that we tend to collect a lot of ideas, and, most of these ideas are straight up trash. While I&#8217;m not exactly working on getting off this addiction anytime soon, what I do want to work on being minimalistic with the ideas I collect. Bad ideas are just like junk food. They&#8217;re going to mess you up in the long run.</p>\n<p>But you&#8217;ll end up collecting them anyway and so will I, what I mean by being minimalistic is consciously thinking about which ideas you really love and which ones you don&#8217;t AND then, there will be the ones that you feel very strongly about. For or against, either way. You&#8217;ll always come across ideas that you want people to not pick up, ideas that you want to speak against. Those are the ideas right next to what I like to think of as &#8220;good ideas&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Consciously filter ideas you find on the internet and elsewhere.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You\u2019re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with. My mom used to say to me, \u201cGarbage in, garbage out.\u201d It used to drive me nuts. But now I know what she meant.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Imitate what you love.</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-257 aligncenter\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2018/02/Copy-and-Amend-300x169.jpg\" alt=\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-and-Amend-300x169.jpg 300w, https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-and-Amend-768x432.jpg 768w, https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-and-Amend.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Start copying what you love.

We don\u2019t come out of the womb knowing who we are. In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes. We learn by copying.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not about plagiarism. It&#8217;s about the practice. Imitate and change an element, imitate and change an element and repeat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Google everything, period.<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-243 aligncenter\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2018/02/Google-300x169.jpg\" alt=\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Google-300x169.jpg 300w, https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Google-768x432.jpg 768w, https://arnavgosain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Google.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>Google everything.

GOOGLE SHIT. You have your phone on you all the time now. Stop whatever you&#8217;re doing and GOOGLE SHIT, period.</p>\n<h3><strong>Create. DON&#8217;T EDIT.

I tend to ammend posts before I even completely finish them. Screw that, I tend to edit my pictures as soon as I take them and fail to notice what&#8217;s going on around me and end up missing out on amazing compositions and just moments in life. I&#8217;m actively trying to get rid of this tendency of mine and you should too.</p>\n<p>You should too, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A:</strong> It&#8217;s going to make your creative process more effecient.</li>\n<li><strong>B: </strong>It&#8217;s going to help you stay in the moment and help you train your subconscience to not get rid of what could&#8217;ve been a great idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there is a lot more from <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/steal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Steal Like An Artist </strong></a>that I want to share with you, I don&#8217;t want to give it all away. You are a creative. (If you think otherwise, you should watch the video I mentioned in the beginning of this post.) And, you should definitely give Steal Like An Artist a read.

In any case, that&#8217;s how I perceived it at the time. Regardless of what they meant, I did. I quit photography for 3 months. And, SURPRISE SURPRISE, it didn&#8217;t do me any good.</p>\n<p>One less thing I was going to be spending time on, what will a dude do? Study? Nah, fantasize. He&#8217;ll fantasize about clicking pictures.</p>\n<h3><strong>And started watching a lot of TV shows</strong></h3>\n<p>Since I wasn&#8217;t doing what I found productive anymore, I had to find a fake sense of satisfaction. A &#8220;yes, I did something <em>kinda\u00a0</em>productive&#8221; to write, at the end of the day, in my diary. So, I started watching a lot of TV shows. Rewatching some I&#8217;d already watched. Stranger Things, Narcos, Arrow, Flash, and more. And some I&#8217;d not watched before. Suits, Person of Interest, Breathe and more.</p>\n<p>A fake sense of satisfaction is the root of all problems.</p>\n<h3><strong>Which lead to me not listening to what inspires me, music and podcasts</strong></h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for music and podcasts and used to listen to them all the time. Until, obviously, I started watching TV shows. They started taking all my time and I didn&#8217;t realize what was at stake i.e, inspiration, until a lot later.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Don&#8217;t stop doing what you love.</p>\n",

Maybe someone has put this across before, and maybe more eloquently than I’m about to. But, as a JS dev of not that long, I feel the need to say it regardless.

Popular JS libraries and frameworks have a reinvention problem.

It feels like every time I blink, a UI framework/state management solution/build tool I’m using has completely changed how it does things. Usually justified by “how much better it is”. Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But that doesn’t change the feeling that we’re chasing our own tails

And sure, there’s a deprecation period and a migration path, it feels but that doesn’t make the constant changing feel any less like we’re chasing our tails.

It’s not just me that feels this way. I frequently see people asking how to do things that were perfectly simple to do before, but have now been needlessly changed.

And the community responds with platitudes like “it’s not that bad”, “you’ll get used to it”, “RTFM!!”. But that doesn’t help when the docs are work in progress. Or when the changes are so fundamental that your existing codebase is now effectively legacy.

Maybe I’m just bad at this. Maybe I’m not keeping up. Maybe I’m not using the tools “the right way”. But I don’t think that’s it.

As a collective, JS library ndevs need to get over this never-ending desire to change for the sake of changing, to chase the next shiny thing.

Maybe it’s time to start thinking about stability and backwards compatibility. Maybe it’s time to start thinking about the people that use our tools, and not just the people that build our tools.

Just a thought.

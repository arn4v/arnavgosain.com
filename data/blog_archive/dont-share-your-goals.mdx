I've always felt weirdly unmotivated after I share my goals, doesn't matter if it's with my parents, friends or on a social media platform. I'm not sure why this is the way it is. It's part insecurity and part impostor syndrome.

For example, yesterday, I posted a story to promote my blog on Instagram and immediately took writing yesterday's post for granted and hence, didn't post anything. I really want more people to closely follow what I'm up to. But at the same time, I don't want anyone to look at these initial posts because they're no good and I know that.

At the moment, I feel that if I hadn't posted that story, I would've been better off mentally. I wouldn't be worrying so much about what people think of me based on these crappy posts but rather thinking about writing another crappy post with the hope that I'll get better with time.

Going forward, I'm going to try to find the sweet spot between promoting my work and still having the mental capacity to write bad posts without thinking about what other people think of me.

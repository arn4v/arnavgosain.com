I'm a huge podcasts guy. I listen to them everywhere. When I wake up? Check. When I'm taking a shower? Check. When I'm driving? Check.  Before I sleep? Check. And quite frankly, I wouldn't be this big into podcasts if it weren't for an extremely well-designed app: [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com).

It's smooth, helps you discover more podcasts, is cross-platform AND also has dark mode!

But it wasn't all because of Pocket Casts, it was also because I found great quality podcasts from the get-go and I'm going to mention some of my favourites below:

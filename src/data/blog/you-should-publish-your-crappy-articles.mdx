I've had this domain name for a while now and I'd wanted to start a blog for a long time at the time of writing this post.

I wanted to write articles and publish them and let readers give me feedback. But my inner perfectionist wouldn't let me. It had to be perfect.

That's exactly why this article sucks. I haven't practiced enough to be in a position that I would be able to write amazing articles. Being afraid of judgment and criticism led me to not do anything with the resources I have right now and those I used to.

And for those exact reasons, I'm writing this post to serve as a reminder to myself to not give a flying crap about the articles I'm going to be writing in the next two years. I've attained peace with the fact that I'm not going to be able to write amazing articles overnight and that my use of language isn't going to improve overnight either.

There are only a few people I know who seem like all they have is time. Others are busy trying to achieve their own goals and ambitions. What I'm trying to say is that no one has the time to judge your article for the use of language.

All anyone cares about is the content. If you're able to get your point across, no one gives a flying crap if you don't have a good grasp over grammar.

At the same time though, you should be aware that you're not the first one to come up with your idea. Your idea is not original. You either came up with it as a result of reading other people's articles or books or watching videos or listening to podcast or whatever thing you're into. You stole what you think is your idea. But it's not about who stole it and who didn't. Every idea that exists in today's world is a rip-off. It's about who was able to execute it better.

TL;DR: Don't care about judgement and publish your article. You'll only get better if you practice and not if you're not.

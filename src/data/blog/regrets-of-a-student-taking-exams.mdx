I had my exams going on for a month until about twenty days ago. It wasn't until that last exam that I realized how stopping certain things, things that inspired me and gave me a sense of satisfaction, had affected my life.Â  Things that kept me sane.

* * *

What's worse is the fact that I was living in an illusion, an illusion where I thought because I'd stopped doing these things I had a narrow focus. Spoiler alert: I didn't. As a matter of fact, I wasn't focussed at all.

### **I stopped clicking pictures**

I have issues focussing on multiple things at once and, so, when talking about the same with someone I respect very much, photography came up. This person wanted me to quit photography for while. Albeit, I'll give them the credit for making it sound like it was a suggestion even though it wasn't. In any case, that's how I perceived it at the time. Regardless of what they meant, I did. I quit photography for 3 months. And, SURPRISE SURPRISE, it didn't do me any good.

One less thing I was going to be spending time on, what will a dude do? Study? Nah, fantasize. He'll fantasize about clicking pictures.

### **And started watching a lot of TV shows**

Since I wasn't doing what I found productive anymore, I had to find a fake sense of satisfaction. A "yes, I did something _kinda_ productive" to write, at the end of the day, in my diary. So, I started watching a lot of TV shows. Rewatching some I'd already watched. Stranger Things, Narcos, Arrow, Flash, and more. And some I'd not watched before. Suits, Person of Interest, Breathe and more.

A fake sense of satisfaction is the root of all problems.

### **Which lead to me not listening to what inspires me, music and podcasts**

I'm a sucker for music and podcasts and used to listen to them all the time. Until, obviously, I started watching TV shows. They started taking all my time and I didn't realize what was at stake i.e, inspiration, until a lot later.

TL;DR: Don't stop doing what you love.

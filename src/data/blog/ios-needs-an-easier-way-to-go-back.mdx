I've been an Android user for as long as I've had smart devices, excluding the iPod Touch I had for a few years. Last month, I got a 6th-generation iPad, and I've been using it for a little more than a month now. I love it; it's excellent. I've been able to pick up on how to write with both of my hands on a touchscreen and hence, I've been able to replace my laptop with it. I love how big the screen is and how iOS handles split-screen.

But I dislike a lot of things too. Hate, even.

iOS needs a dedicated back button. I don't care if it's optional, it just needs a dedicated back button. You see, I primarily use my iPad to either write blog posts or make notes and I mostly use Google Docs to do these tasks.

Google Docs has the same design across both iOS and Android.

At times, when I'm not using both of my hands to time and just typing with my thumbs, I have to reach all the way to the top, tap on the tick icon and then tap on the back button. Whereas on Android, I need to touch the back button twice without to reach the top corners of the screen.

And for those of you who might argue that this happens because it's a third-party app, it doesn't. It also occurs when I'm trying to send a file through iOS' Files app to a Telegram contact. To cancel sending a document, I have to reach all the way to the top right corner and tap Cancel.

I love iOS, I genuinely do. But I can't get over how comfortable and straightforward it is to use the same apps I use on iOS, on Android.

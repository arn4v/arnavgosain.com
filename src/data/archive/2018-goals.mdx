I follow a lot of people who tweet what their goals are and check up on them at the end of that year. GREAT IDEA. So, I decided I wanted to do the same, and, I did. But then, I thought I might as well write a blog post about them because why not. But I do hope that maybe, just, maybe one day when I'm famous because I acted upon these goals people would revisit this post and help me earn some of that Adsense money. Lol.

## **Why I think setting goals is important:**

What I think of why setting goals are important aligns perfectly with what others think of the same. Every now-successful person once set goals people they thought were impossible to achieve. Goals help you visualize where you want to be in life. They're your guiding force. Your goals define you and you define your priorities. It's simple. Your priorities are based on one thing that leads to the other and so on and so forth and eventually leads you to think "Maybe I should put in more time into this." But, nothing in life is definite.

When setting goals you think of "Oh, maybe if I achieve this right now I'll end up achieving this by the end of the year". Again, nothing in life is definite. NOTHING. It's always a maybe. That's why goals are important. They are mysteries ready to unfold if you put in the effort to try to figure out what they have in store for you. You will never know what they'll lead you to until you end up achieving them. It's true for both microscopic and macroscopic goals.

Macroscopic goals are long and definite. A good example of a macroscopic goal would be that "I want to write 200 blog posts next year." This is regardless of the smaller, microscopic goals which are to write one blog post at a time. Microscopic goals go hand in hand with macroscopic goals. Without a larger-than-life goal, you can't think of smaller goals.

If you think you don't know how to set goals or just need another perspective on it, you should go watch [Cody & Sarah Jensen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3FWVimh9nY) on the same.

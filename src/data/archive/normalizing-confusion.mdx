I remember the months leading up to my 10th-grade final exams. They were extremely stressful, not just because I had to prepare for my exams but because there was an underlying expectation that had gone unaddressed for a while.

I was expected to opt for science because in classic Indian parent fashion – "mera beta to engineer hi banega". I remember responding to my parents' questions regarding my preparation with a simple "they're alright" all the time. I was confused.

I didn't know what science would entail, neither commerce nor humanities. I didn't know what I could be if I opted for science, other than becoming an Engineer, of course. Neither did I know what I could become if I had opted for commerce, nor humanities.

At 15 years of age, I was magically supposed to know about every single career choice that existed and act accordingly, even before I knew what I enjoyed doing after school. It is an extremely bad position to be in and the worse position to put your child in if you're a parent.

It is important to not get into things you before you have all the facts in front of you and can make an educated decision. Not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, and still not knowing what I want to do with my life has helped me experiment. It has helped me explore different sides of myself and I've often found myself surprising myself.

So, as far as I'm concerned, it is okay to be confused. And it is important to normalize confusion. At least as far as life decisions are concerned. Especially at 15 years of age.

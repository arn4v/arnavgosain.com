Last year I made a list of things I wanted to achieve. One of the things on that list was that I wanted to blog regularly, but I couldn't keep up. It wasn't about not having enough ideas, it was about not realizing that what I put out did matter and hence, not executing any of them.

Now, after going riding through the wave that 2018 was, even though I care a lot about what people think, I know that I will not be able to write good, concise and articulate essays/posts without actually writing bad ones.

This is going to come out bad, really bad, and I'm okay with that because I know that at the end of this year, I will be able to write better.

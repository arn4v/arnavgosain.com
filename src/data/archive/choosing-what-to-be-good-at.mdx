The Internet is vast. Millions of websites with hundreds of millions of pages and a lot of them, if not all them, containÂ knowledge you could acquire. It's wonderful, for the most part, but in my experience, it can often be very intimidating.

I've found myself asking the weirdest of questions at the oddest of times.

"Is this the right way to do this?"

"What other skill could I acquire?"

"Do I have enough skills?"

All of these questions often leading to the monstrous "Am I good enough?".

Usually, these intrusive thoughts pop in my head when I'm browsing a website.

For example, A couple of minutes ago I was browsing Reddit and I came across a painting.

A Caspar David Friedrich painting.

I looked at it for a few seconds and immediately thought "I want to learn how to paint like that so bad!". But, at the same time, I don't want to be the jack of all trades. I can't be good at everything. Not in this lifetime.

In 2019, I want to work hardest on consolidating the skills I already have and discard those I don't see myself using in the near future.

If I could paint like Caspar David Friedrich from the get-go, painting would be super fun, sure! But, as much as I hate to hear it, I'm never going to be able to paint like him, not without putting in 10000 hours into learning painting. What I could do instead, is try to be the best at one of my acquired skills. Not today, no, but surely, one day. One day.

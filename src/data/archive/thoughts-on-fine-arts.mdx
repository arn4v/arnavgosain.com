I've spent the better part of last month and a half writing essays for my college applications. A lot of these essays have been about **why** I want to attend a certain university and the backbone of these essays have been my desire to make informed art, art that doesn't just exist for the sake of existing.

Throughout my time on Instagram, following all sorts of artists, I've learnt that being able to have an idea and executing it without a solid meaning behind it is not everyone's cup of tea. And it most certainly isn't mine.

But, at the same time, a lot of my photographs have been abstract street photos. A lot of them don't have a meaning if you're unable to imagine the subject's emotions. So, even though they can technically be categorized under _fine art,_ it's still not art that exists for the sake of existing. It doesn't allow you to go wild with your interpretations.

I've been out of school for about a year now and it's been hard trying to develop a schedule. I don't work. I freelance but not actively. And hence, I stay at home most of the time. I don't really have any issues with staying at home but every once in a while, it gets to me.

I'd be lying if I told you that, while at home, I work to achieve my goals all the time. It gets really hard to focus without having a physical place to remind me what I'm working towards. Like, when you're in school, you're reminded of that you're working towards scoring in your exams because you have to sit in numerous classes throughout the day. At home? You're your own boss.

In August, if I remember correctly, I actively started trying to work on maintaining a schedule. Waking up in the morning, writing my goals in my diary while having breakfast, studying throughout the day and then going on a short walk with my brother. It worked.

It made me very happy until the day I fell out of it. It's been a couple of weeks since and everything just seems to get harder and harder. Sleep schedule? Not on track. Study schedule? Not on track. Reading schedule? Not on track. It's not like I'm not trying to get all of these things back on track, it's just that being in the same physical space every day while trying to make changes that are mostly mental.

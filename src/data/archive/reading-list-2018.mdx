I've never been your overly enthusiastic reader or even a slightly enthusiastic reader for that matter. I don't remember being interested in reading when I was a kid. When asked for what I wanted on my birthday I remember asking for RC cars, board games, computer games and whatnot but that list did not include books. I never considered reading to be worth my time and that too, to the point where I stopped reading my course books.

Two months prior to 2017 I ended up buying myself a Kindle for more money than I could've afforded at the time. I thought would read as much as I can because now I have this really thin and portable device with all the books I want to read on it. Mostly because I'd become pretty comfortable on my phone so I set a pretty unrealistic goal of reading 24 books throughout and as _unrealistic_ suggests, I did not end up reading all of them. In fact, I did not even read half of them.

In 2018, I want to attempt the goal I set in 2017, again.

How this list is going to work is:

- **Bolded books** are the ones on my priority list. They are the ones I will read no matter what.
- Unbolded books are the ones that I want to read but they aren't a priority.
- Underlined books are the ones I want to revisit.
